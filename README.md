Welcome! 👋

I'm new to coding in R, and this repository is a place where I document my progress, experiments, and projects as I strengthen my skills. Whether it’s data analysis, visualization, or general scripting, I’m exploring different aspects of R and learning along the way.

What to Expect


✔ Beginner-friendly R scripts and projects 📂


✔ Data exploration and visualization with ggplot2 📊


✔ Hands-on practice with data manipulation 🛠️


✔ A growing collection of lessons and improvements over time 🔄

Why This Repo Exists
This repository is all about learning in public—sharing my journey, mistakes, and progress. If you're also learning R or have tips to share, feel free to follow along, provide feedback, or suggest improvements!

Let’s grow together. Happy coding! ✨
